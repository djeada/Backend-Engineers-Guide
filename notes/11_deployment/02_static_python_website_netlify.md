## Deploying Static Python Website on Netlify

Netlify allows you to easily deploy and manage static websites.

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Create a repository**: Create a Git repository containing your static Python website code.

2. **Sign up for Netlify**: If you don't have an account, sign up at [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/).

3. **Connect your repository**: Link your Git repository to Netlify.

   - In the Netlify dashboard, click on "New site from Git".
   - Choose your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
   - Select the repository with your static Python website code.

4. **Configure build settings**: Set up build settings for your website.

   - Specify the build command for your project, if required.
   - Set the publish directory (usually `dist` or `public`).
   - Click "Deploy site" to start the deployment process.

5. **Domain settings**: Configure your custom domain or use the auto-generated one provided by Netlify.

   - Go to the "Domain settings" section of your site dashboard.
   - Set up a custom domain or use the default Netlify subdomain.
   - If using a custom domain, configure DNS settings with your domain registrar.

6. **SSL/TLS**: Secure your site with HTTPS using Let's Encrypt.

   - Netlify provides free SSL/TLS certificates through Let's Encrypt.
   - In the "Domain settings" section, click "SSL/TLS certificate" to set it up.

7. **Monitor deployment**: Check the status of your deployment.

   - In the site dashboard, monitor the progress and status of your deployment.
   - Once the deployment is complete, your website is live and accessible via the specified domain.

With these steps, you can easily deploy and manage your static Python website on Netlify.
