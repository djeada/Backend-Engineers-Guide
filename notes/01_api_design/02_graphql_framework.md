# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. Unlike REST, which uses a predefined structure for responses, GraphQL allows the client to define the structure of the response data. 

## Basics of GraphQL

- **Schema Definition Language (SDL)**: GraphQL has its own type system that’s used to define the schema of an API.

- **Resolvers**: The functions that connect schema fields and types to various backends.

- **Queries**: The operation for reading data.

- **Mutations**: The operation for writing data.

- **Subscriptions**: The operation for real-time data updates.

## Advantages of GraphQL

- Fetching many resources in a single request.
- Tailoring requests to your needs: Ask for what you need, get exactly that.
- Powerful developer tools: Insightful and interactive exploratory interfaces.

## Comparison: GraphQL vs REST

- Single request vs multiple requests: With GraphQL, you can send a single complex query to the server, and it gets exactly what it needs in one go.
  
- Over-fetching and under-fetching problems are mitigated in GraphQL.

- API versioning can be avoided in GraphQL.

## Creating a GraphQL API

- Define your types and fields.
- Set up your data source.
- Define resolvers for types.

## Best Practices for GraphQL API Design

- Designing a clear, understandable schema.
  
- Handling errors in a user-friendly way.

- Secure your GraphQL API: Don’t expose sensitive information, and prevent malicious queries.

- Consider performance implications: While GraphQL is efficient, complex queries can lead to performance issues.

- API Documentation: Just like REST, clear, comprehensive documentation is essential.
