# API Communication Protocols

## gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
- **Protocol**: An open-source RPC framework that uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language.
- **Usage**: Ideal for low latency, highly scalable, distributed systems and polyglot environments.
- **Communication**: Enables streaming requests and responses, supporting unary (single request-response), server streaming, client streaming, and bidirectional streaming.
- **Data Format**: Primarily uses Protocol Buffers, a binary serialization tool.

## REST (Representational State Transfer)
- **Protocol**: An architectural style for distributed systems, not a protocol or a standard, but uses HTTP as its underlying protocol.
- **Usage**: Commonly used for web APIs, known for its simplicity and ease of use.
- **Communication**: Stateless client-server communication, typically using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- **Data Format**: Can use various formats like JSON, XML, YAML, etc.

## GraphQL
- **Protocol**: A query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data.
- **Usage**: Suitable for complex systems with multiple entities and relationships, providing clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more.
- **Communication**: Single endpoint with queries and mutations; allows clients to fetch or mutate multiple resources in a single request.
- **Data Format**: Primarily uses JSON.
