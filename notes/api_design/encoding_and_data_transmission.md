## Data Conversion and Sharing

Data conversion involves changing the format of data so it can be easily understood, manipulated, or transferred between different systems or applications. This is often accomplished via encoding.

### Encoding

Encoding refers to the process of transforming data into a format that can be stored, transmitted, and understood by different systems. This plays a vital role in data communication and storage, enabling different machines and systems to share and interpret data.

### Popular Encodings

* **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used for asynchronous browser/server communication.

* **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**: XML is a markup language much like HTML and was designed to store and transport data. It is self-descriptive and human readable, though typically more verbose than JSON.

* **Binary Encoding**: There are situations where custom binary encoding is preferable, like in high-performance computing or networking. Binary encodings can be much smaller and faster to process, as they don't need to be parsed in the way that text encodings like JSON or XML do.

### Custom Binary Encoding

* Custom binary encodings are especially beneficial when dealing with complex and voluminous data as they can efficiently pack data, resulting in saved space and faster data transfer.

* A pre-defined schema is typically required to effectively use a custom binary encoding. The schema outlines the structure of the data, the types of fields, and their ordering. This allows applications to interpret the binary data correctly.

* A system for managing and versioning schemas can help to track compatibility between different versions of the data and allow for type checking during the software development process.

### Compatibility and Versioning

* While designing schemas, it's crucial to maintain forward and backward compatibility. This ensures that newer applications can interpret data from older versions, and older applications can still process data generated by newer versions.

* One common strategy for maintaining backward compatibility is to make sure that any new fields added to the schema are optional, or provide a default value. This allows older versions of the software to correctly process the new data, even if they don't understand the new fields.

* Compatibility and versioning are vital in distributed systems where different components might be updated at different times, and yet they still need to communicate effectively.
