## Real-time Communication Methods

Real-time communication methods provide live updates from application servers to clients in a swift manner. The advantages and disadvantages of each method should be considered according to specific use cases.

### Long Polling

Long Polling is a technique where the client sends a request to the server, and the server keeps the request open until it has new information to send. Once the client receives new information, it immediately sends another request.

- **Benefits**: 
  - Easier to implement compared to other methods.
  - Provides a fallback for browsers that lack support for newer technologies.
  - More real-time compared to traditional polling techniques.

- **Drawbacks**: 
  - Can tie up server resources due to maintaining open connections, particularly with a large number of clients.
  - In cases where requests are timed out, they have to be managed and retried manually.
  - Network latency can impact the 'real-time' nature of updates.

### WebSockets

WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel between the client and server. After the connection is established, data can be sent in either direction independently, which allows for a more interactive and reactive form of communication.

- **Benefits**:
  - Less overhead since headers are not retransmitted with each message.
  - Enables real-time bi-directional communication between client and server.
  - Supports handling of a large number of open connections.

- **Drawbacks**:
  - Implementation can be complex due to the need for a specific WebSocket server or library.
  - Not fully supported across all web browsers or network infrastructures.
  - Additional security considerations may be required as it bypasses the traditional HTTP request-response model.

### Server-Sent Events

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a standard where a server pushes updates to a client whenever it has new information. The client maintains an open connection to the server, ready to receive these updates.

- **Benefits**:
  - Useful for applications where the server generates data in a loop and sends updates to clients.
  - More efficient than constant polling or long polling.
  - Built upon the HTTP protocol, hence supported by most infrastructure and network configurations.

- **Drawbacks**:
  - Provides one-way communication only (server to client).
  - Limited by the number of open connections a browser can have.
  - Depending on network conditions, the TCP connection used by SSE might get closed, requiring reconnection logic.
