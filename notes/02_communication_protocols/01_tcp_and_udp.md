## TCP vs UDP

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are cornerstone transport protocols, enabling diverse applications to communicate over networks. Understanding their characteristics is key for network software development.

In essence, TCP is like sending a registered letter that requires a signature upon receipt, whereas UDP is akin to sending a regular letter that could potentially get lost in the mail. TCP ensures the message gets through without error, and UDP gets the message out quickly.

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures the reliable, ordered delivery of data between sender and receiver.

- **Three-way Handshake**: To establish a TCP connection, a procedure known as a "three-way handshake" is used. This ensures both parties are ready for data transmission and allows them to acknowledge the connection setup.
- **Data Transfer and Acknowledgments**: Once the connection is established, the data transfer process begins. For each packet sent, an acknowledgment is expected. If an acknowledgment isn't received within a specified time, the sender retransmits the packet.
- **Flow Control**: TCP uses a sliding window mechanism to avoid overwhelming the receiver with data. The window size can be adjusted dynamically depending on network conditions and receiver capabilities.
- **Congestion Control**: TCP uses several algorithms to detect network congestion and adjust the data transmission rate accordingly to maintain optimal network performance.
- **Connection Termination**: A connection is terminated when the session is complete, and it follows a four-way handshake method to ensure both parties agree to the termination.

  |                                           |
  | ------ SYN (Sequence Number x) ------>    |
  |                                           |
  | <----- SYN-ACK (Sequence Number y,        |
  |         Acknowledgment Number x+1) ----   |
  |                                           |
  | ------ ACK (Acknowledgment Number y+1) -> |
  |                                           |
```

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

UDP is a connectionless protocol that offers a fast but less reliable service compared to TCP.

- **No Connection Setup and Teardown**: As a connectionless protocol, UDP doesn't need to establish or terminate a connection before data transfer. It simply sends the data without any setup.
- **Datagram-Based**: UDP sends data in discrete units called datagrams, each of which is independently sent and may arrive out of order.
- **No Acknowledgments**: Unlike TCP, UDP doesn't wait for acknowledgments from the receiver. As a result, there's no mechanism to detect lost packets, and any error detection and correction has to be implemented at the application level.
- **Checksums**: Although UDP is a lightweight protocol, it includes a checksum for data integrity, but this is optional and can be disabled.
- **Applications of UDP**: Due to its lightweight nature, UDP is suitable for applications like video and audio streaming where real-time data delivery is more important than guaranteeing every packet is successfully delivered.

  |                                           |
  (no acknowledgment from the server)
  |                                           |
  | <------ UDP Data Packet (Response) ------ |
  |                                           |
