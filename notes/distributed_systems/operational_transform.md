## Operational Transform (OT)

Operational Transform is a technique in distributed systems for real-time collaborative editing of shared documents.

## Collaborative Editing Challenges

Collaborative editing can be difficult in distributed systems because:

- Multiple users can modify the document at the same time.
- Coordination or synchronization is needed to prevent inconsistencies or corruption.

## How OT Works

OT transforms a sequence of edits by:

- Analyzing the meaning of the edits.
- Identifying potential conflicts or inconsistencies.
- Creating a new sequence of edits to apply without causing conflicts.

## Types of Operations

OT can transform operations like:

- Insertion: Adding new content to the document.
- Deletion: Removing existing content from the document.
- Move: Changing content position within the document.
- Format: Changing the style or formatting of content.

## Implementing OT

Implementing OT can be challenging due to:

- The need for a suitable data model to represent the document.
- The development of algorithms to transform operations.

Popular OT implementations include:

- Google Docs: A web-based collaborative editing platform using OT to synchronize changes.
- ShareJS: An open-source OT library for custom applications.
