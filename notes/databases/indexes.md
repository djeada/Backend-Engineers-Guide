## Database Indexing

Database indexing, a technique to accelerate data retrieval, has a rich history dating back to the early days of computer science. As a technique, it's akin to the index section in a book - helping you quickly locate data without having to scan each page (or in our case, database row). While it expedites read operations, it imposes additional overhead on write operations as indexes must be kept in sync with data.

### A Dive into Indexing Structures

Several indexing structures have been invented and refined over the years, each with its unique strengths and trade-offs.

#### Log-Structured Storage: An Immutable Approach

Born out of the need for better write performance and recovery characteristics, log-structured storage appends all changes to a log, which is an ordered sequence of operations. This structure provides excellent write characteristics, but reading data requires searching through the log. Hence, it's usually complemented with data structures like Hash Indexes, SSTables, and LSM Trees.

##### Hash Indexes: Fast, But Memory Hungry

Hash indexes are a classic example of a space-time trade-off. They provide constant-time complexity for write and lookup operations but require that all keys fit in memory, which can be a limiting factor for large datasets. They also struggle with range queries, which require scanning all keys.

##### SSTables and LSM-Trees: Balancing Memory and Disk

Sorted String Tables (SSTables) and Log-Structured Merge-Trees (LSM-Trees) are refinements over log-structured storage. They keep segments sorted by key and maintain several in-memory tables (Memtables) and on-disk tables (SSTables) to achieve a balance between memory usage and write/read performance. Compaction and merging are vital processes here, eliminating redundant entries and enhancing read performance.

#### B-Trees: A Balanced and Sorted Approach

B-Trees, the heart of many traditional RDBMS indexing mechanisms, hold a special place in database lore. The elegance of B-Trees lies in their self-balancing property, ensuring the tree remains optimally balanced after insertions and deletions, leading to consistent read and write performance. B-Trees divide data into blocks or pages, operating on one page at a time, making them suitable for disk-based storage. 

### Secondary Indexes: Additional Avenues for Access

Secondary indexes, while providing alternative paths to access data, introduce additional complexity. They can be built using any of the aforementioned data structures, linking secondary keys to primary keys or direct record addresses. You can view them as 'shortcut routes' to your data based on non-primary key columns.

Secondary indexes can either point to the primary storage or can include actual row data (covered or clustered indexes). Their use becomes critical when dealing with large datasets where scanning the primary index becomes untenable. However, they come with additional write and storage overhead.

Multi-column indexes are an extension of this concept, providing fast access for queries involving multiple columns. Use them judiciously as each added dimension contributes to write overhead and storage requirements.
