## Transactions in Databases

Transactions help manage writes and ensure data consistency in databases. They allow writes to be committed or rolled back based on the operation's success or failure.

## ACID Properties

Transactions in databases follow the ACID properties:

- **Atomicity**: All writes within a transaction are a single, atomic operation. If a fault occurs, any completed writes are rolled back.
- **Consistency**: The database ensures data remains consistent, even with faults.
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions are isolated from one another. Most databases use weak isolation levels for better performance.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is completed, the data is permanent, even with faults.

## Single Object Writes

For single object writes, most database engines provide atomicity and isolation:

- Atomicity can be achieved using a log for crash recovery.
- Isolation can be implemented using a lock on each object.
