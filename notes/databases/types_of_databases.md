## Types of Databases

Databases store persistent data and prevent issues like data loss or server sync problems.

### Relational Databases (SQL)

- Use tables with rows of structured data.
- Rows in different tables can be related through common keys.
- Built-in query optimizer for SQL statements (declarative language).
- Good for structured and transactional data.
- Mature tools and libraries available.
- Good for complex queries and data integrity.
- Less performant for large unstructured data.

### Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

- Use collections of key-value pairs with flexible structure.
- Good for unstructured and semi-structured data.
- Handle large data amounts and high concurrency levels.
- Flexible data models, easier migrations.
- Horizontally scalable for cloud and distributed environments.
- Good for simple queries and high data availability.
- Not ideal for complex joins and transactions.

### Graph Databases (NoSQL)

- Store data as vertices and edges in a graph.
- Good for both homogenous and heterogeneous data.
- Ideal for complex relationships, such as social networks, recommendation systems, and routing algorithms.
- Good for traversing large datasets and discovering patterns.
- Not suitable for high write loads and large unstructured data.

In conclusion, choose a database type based on your application's specific needs. Relational databases are best for structured and transactional data, NoSQL databases work well with unstructured and semi-structured data, and graph databases excel with complex relationships.
