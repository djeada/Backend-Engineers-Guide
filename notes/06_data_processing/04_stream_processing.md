## Stream Processing

Stream processing involves ingesting, analyzing, and taking action on data *as it is produced*. This near-real-time or real-time methodology is *helpful* for applications that need to respond quickly to continuously updating information, such as IoT sensor readings, financial transactions, or social media data. By processing events or records as they arrive, systems can *quickly* generate insights, trigger alerts, or update dashboards without waiting for a complete batch.

```

+---------------+      +---------------------------------+      +--------------+
|               |      | Stream Processing               |      |              |
| Data Sources  +----->+    (Real-time/Near-real-time)   +----->+ Final Output |
| (Sensors, etc.)      |   +-----+   +-----+   +-----+   |      | (Dashboard, |
+---------------+      |   | P1  |   | P2  |   | P3  |   |      |  Alerts, etc.) 
                       +----+-----+---+-----+---+-----+---+      +--------------+
```

- A data stream is **continuously** produced by various sources, like logs, sensors, or user activities.  
- A stream processing system **consumes** these events as they arrive, applying transformations, aggregations, or filtering.  
- Final results, such as alerts, dashboards, or enriched data records, are **emitted** with minimal delay.

### Message Brokers

Message brokers provide asynchronous communication between producing and consuming services, often serving as a backbone for stream processing pipelines.

- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming messages across *multiple* consumers.  
- **Fan-out**: Broadcasts messages so every subscribed consumer can *receive* a copy.  
- **Queue vs. Pub-Sub**: A queue model is *often* used for point-to-point communication (one consumer), while pub-sub broadcasts messages to multiple subscribers.

```

  Publisher(s)             Message Broker           Consumer(s)
+------------+     (Push)     +-----------+     (Pull)  +------------+
|  Service A |  ---------->   |   Topic   |  <----------|  Service B |
+------------+               +-----+-----+             +------------+
                                     \
                                      +------------+
                                      | Service C  |
                                      +------------+
```

- This log-based structure can be **critical** in ensuring message ordering and replay capabilities for consumers.  
- Topic partitioning is **often** used to scale throughput and handle fault tolerance.

### Log-Based Message Brokers

Log-based brokers (like Apache Kafka) store messages in an immutable, append-only log. Consumers read from an **offset** that tracks their position, allowing for replaying messages or consuming them at different rates.

- **Sequential** processing lets consumers receive messages in the order produced, crucial for maintaining consistency.  
- **Partitioning** topics across multiple logs provides **scalability**; each partition can be processed by a separate consumer or consumer group.

```
ASCII DIAGRAM: Log-Based Broker (Conceptual)

               +---------+
Producer --->  | Partition 0 | ---> Consumer Group 1
               +---------+
Producer --->  | Partition 1 | ---> Consumer Group 2
               +---------+
Producer --->  | Partition 2 | ---> Consumer Group 2
               +---------+
```

- Each partition is **independent**, so reading from one partition does not affect the offsets in another.  
- If a consumer fails, another consumer in the group can **take over** reading from the partition where it left off.

### Change Data Capture (CDC)

CDC captures and streams **row-level** database changes in real time. By converting inserts, updates, and deletes into event streams, CDC simplifies synchronizing data across systems.

- **Event Generation**: Whenever a record in the database changes, an event is appended to the stream.  
- **Data Synchronization**: Downstream services or microservices can **subscribe** to these change events, ensuring they have up-to-date data without heavy polling.

```
ASCII DIAGRAM: CDC Flow

   Database            CDC Engine                Message Broker               Consumers
+------------+   +---------------+           +---------------+          +-----------------+
|  Table(s)  |-->| Binlog Reader | --------> |   Topic(s)    |  ----->  | Microservices  |
+------------+   +---------------+           +-------+-------+          +-----------------+
                                                    |
                                                    v
                                             +---------------+
                                             |   Analytics   |
                                             +---------------+
```

This approach is **especially** popular for maintaining read replicas, caches, or downstream analytics systems in near real time.

### Event Sourcing

Event Sourcing maintains an append-only log of all **state changes** in an application, rather than storing only the latest state. By replaying these events, the application’s state can be reconstructed at any point in time, providing excellent **auditability** and historical insight.

- **Event Log**: All changes are appended as discrete events, forming a chronological record.  
- **State Reconstruction**: The current or past state is obtained by replaying every event from the start, or from a known checkpoint.  
- **Debugging & Auditing**: Full history of changes can be **helpful** for diagnosing issues or analyzing user actions.

### Streams and Time

Time management in distributed stream systems can be **complex** due to network delays and clock drift. Common windowing strategies address how events are grouped over time:

1. **Hopping Windows**  
   - Fixed-size windows, with a “hop” period that is **larger** than the window size, leaving gaps in coverage.  
   - Example: Window of size 6 minutes, but a new window starts every 10 minutes, leading to partial coverage.  

2. **Sliding Windows**  
   - Overlapping windows, each capturing a fixed duration but **starting** at smaller intervals.  
   - Example: A 6-minute window slides every 2 minutes, allowing continuous coverage of data.  

3. **Tumbling Windows**  
   - Consecutive, non-overlapping windows of a fixed **size**.  
   - Example: Every 6 minutes forms a new batch of events with no overlap or gap.

```
ASCII DIAGRAM: Time Window Examples (Conceptual)

Hopping (Size=6, Hop=10)
[0---6]             [10--16]            [20--26]  

Sliding (Size=6, Slide=2)
[0---6]
   [2---8]
      [4---10]
         [6---12]  

Tumbling (Size=6)
[0---6][6---12][12--18][18--24]
```

### Stream Joins

Joining data in a streaming environment allows correlation of events from multiple sources or combining real-time events with reference data.

- **Stream-Stream Join**: Correlates events arriving on two (or more) streams, requiring stateful tracking of unjoined events until a corresponding match arrives.  
- **Stream-Table Join**: Combines a stream of incoming events with a static or slowly changing table (often a cached copy).  
- **Table-Table Join**: Involves joining two changing datasets, typically kept in sync via CDC or event sourcing.

```
ASCII DIAGRAM: Stream-Stream Join (Conceptual)

Stream A (Orders)         Join on OrderID          Stream B (Payments)
     (A1)  ------------------>   +--------------+   <---------------- (B1)
     (A2)  ------------------>   |  Join State  |   <---------------- (B2)
     (A3)  ------------------>   +--------------+   <---------------- (B3)
```

Intermediate state must be **maintained** to match events from each stream within a specified time window.

### Fault Tolerance

Ensuring a streaming system remains reliable in the face of failures is **critical**:

- **Micro-batching** can simplify fault-tolerance, treating short spans of data as a batch.  
- **Checkpointing** periodically saves the progress (offsets, partial aggregations) to stable storage.  
- **Idempotent** operations allow reprocessing events without duplicating side effects.

```
ASCII DIAGRAM: Checkpointing Example

        Stream
          |
          v
+---------+---------+
| Stream Processing |
+---------+---------+
          |
          | (Periodic Save State)
          v
+------------------+
|  Checkpoint Store|
+------------------+
```

When a node fails, it can **recover** from the latest checkpoint, replaying only the events since that point.
