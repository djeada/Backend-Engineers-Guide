## Batch Processing

Batch processing is a method for handling large volumes of data by grouping them into a single **batch**, typically without immediate user interaction. It is often **useful** in scenarios where tasks can be processed independently and do not require real-time results, such as nightly analytics jobs, building machine learning models, or transforming data for further analysis. A well-known paradigm in this domain is **MapReduce**, which operates across distributed clusters to handle massive datasets in parallel.

- Accumulating data is **helpful** when a system collects information over a period before processing it in bulk.  
- A data storage layer is **beneficial** for holding raw inputs until the batch system is ready to run jobs.  
- A batch processing system is **designed** to handle sequential or parallel tasks that operate on large datasets.  
- Final outputs can be **used** for analytics, reporting, or to feed into further data pipelines.  

### MapReduce

MapReduce is a two-phase process (Map and Reduce) that breaks down a dataset into smaller tasks, distributing them across multiple nodes. It automates data distribution, task coordination, and failure handling, making it **valuable** for large-scale batch processing.

                   | (Combined Data) |
                   +-----------------+
```

- The map stage is **important** for processing large datasets in parallel by dividing them into smaller chunks.  
- The shuffle and sort phase is **central** to grouping intermediate key-value pairs that share the same key.  
- The reduce phase is **responsible** for aggregating or combining data based on these keys to produce the final results.  
- Handling node failures is **intrinsic** to MapReduce, which can re-run tasks on other nodes if a mapper or reducer fails.  

### Joins in MapReduce

Performing joins combines data from different sources or tables. There are multiple **ways** to execute joins in a MapReduce context:

- A **sort-merge** join (reduce-side join) sends both datasets through mappers keyed by the join field, then merges them in the reducer.  
- A **broadcast hash** join (map-side join) is **helpful** when one dataset is small enough to fit in memory on each mapper.  
- A **partitioned hash** join (map-side join) is **appropriate** when both datasets need partitioning by the same key to avoid memory issues.

```
ASCII DIAGRAM: Sort-Merge Join (Conceptual)

  Dataset A          Dataset B
  (Mapped by Key)    (Mapped by Key)
         \              /
          \            /
           \    Shuffle   /
            \          /
             \        /
        (Reduce: Merge on Key)
                 |
               Output
```

- Each mapper is **configured** to emit (key, value) pairs, where key is the join column.  
- The reducer then **collects** all pairs with the same key and merges them accordingly.  

### When to Use Batch Processing

- Data analytics tasks can be **handled** effectively by periodically aggregating large volumes of data.  
- Building search indexes is **practical** by refreshing them nightly or weekly in a batch job.  
- Machine learning pipelines often **require** large batch transformations before model training.  
- ETL workflows can be **simplified** by loading, cleansing, and restructuring data in bulk.  

### Alternatives to MapReduce

Although MapReduce has been **popular** for massive-scale processing, newer frameworks and models offer different trade-offs:

- **Apache Spark**: Adds in-memory computing to avoid writing intermediate results to disk, which is **faster** for iterative algorithms.  
- **Pregel Model**: Uses a vertex-centric approach for graph processing, which is **advantageous** for social network analysis or recommendation engines.  
- **Hive & Pig**: Provide higher-level languages on top of MapReduce, making development **easier** for SQL-like queries or dataflow scripts.
