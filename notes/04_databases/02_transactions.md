## Database Transactions

In the early days of database systems, the need for a systematic way to manage changes to data quickly became apparent. This led to the concept of "database transactions." Like a transaction in a financial system, a database transaction is a logical unit of work that may encompass multiple operations. It ensures that the database transitions from one consistent state to another, even in the face of concurrent accesses and system failures.

### ACID: The Cornerstones of Transaction Management

The principles that govern database transactions are summed up in the ACID acronym, representing Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

- **Atomicity**: Atomicity implies indivisibility. Within the scope of a transaction, all changes (writes and updates) are treated as a single operation. This means if a transaction is interrupted (for instance, by a system crash or a network issue), any changes that were part of that transaction are rolled back, maintaining the integrity of the database.

- **Consistency**: Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, adhering to predefined rules and constraints. If a transaction results in a violation of these rules, the entire transaction is rolled back.

- **Isolation**: In the real world, multiple transactions often occur concurrently. Isolation ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially. Most databases implement various isolation levels to strike a balance between data integrity and performance.

- **Durability**: Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the event of a power loss, crash, or any kind of system failure.

### Dealing with Single Object Writes

Single object writes form the most basic type of transaction. For such transactions:

- **Atomicity**: Atomicity can be achieved using a write-ahead log (WAL). Before any changes are made to the database, they are logged in the WAL, enabling a recovery mechanism in case of a crash during the transaction.

- **Isolation**: Isolation can be provided using locks or MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control). A lock-based protocol restricts access to a data object once a transaction has locked it for use. In contrast, MVCC allows multiple transactions to read the same object without locks by creating a new version of an object for each transaction, thereby increasing concurrency.

### Advanced Transaction Management

Beyond single object writes, transactions can become more complex, involving multiple objects and operations. Managing these requires sophisticated techniques:

- **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**: Used in distributed systems to ensure all parties in a transaction agree to commit or rollback, maintaining atomicity across systems.
- **Deadlock Detection and Prevention**: Techniques to handle situations where transactions are waiting indefinitely for resources locked by each other.
