### Analyzing Data with Data Warehouses

Data Warehousing is a method used to process and calculate historical data. Unlike the main transactional database, data is extracted from transaction databases, transformed, and loaded into a data warehouse that is optimized for reading large datasets.

#### Star and Snowflake Schemas

Analytics tables in data warehouses are typically organized using star and snowflake schemas:

- The fact table is the central table that records key events, such as grocery store sales.
- The fact table includes multiple foreign keys that link to rows in various dimension tables, such as product or customer tables.
- The snowflake schema is an extension of the star schema where dimension tables have additional sub-dimension tables.

#### Column-Oriented Storage

Data warehouses utilize column-oriented storage to enhance the speed of analytical queries:

- In row-oriented storage, common in non-analytical databases, all values in a row are stored close together.
- Column-oriented storage stores each column's values together, maintaining the order of the values as in the table rows, which improves reading speed.
- Column values can be compressed to save space.
    - Bitmap encoding is used when there are fewer distinct values in a column compared to the number of rows.
    - Bitmap encoding can be further compressed using run-length encoding by recording the frequency of repeating 0s and 1s.

#### Sorting and Materialized Views

- Sorting columns in the same order can speed up queries and improve column compression.
- Data warehouse replicas can be sorted differently to optimize specific queries.
- Materialized views are precomputed queries that cache results to avoid recalculating data repeatedly.
    - This speeds up query response times but increases write latency and reduces flexibility compared to querying raw data.
    - A data cube is a specialized materialized view that aggregates data by two dimensions, such as date and product number, to determine total sales for each combination.

#### Writing Challenges and LSM-Trees

- Writing in the middle of a sorted list is challenging in column-oriented storage.
- LSM-trees allow efficient writing and rewriting of column segments, facilitating changes in column-oriented storage.

### Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL)

ETL is a critical process in data warehousing, involving extracting data from different sources, transforming it to fit operational needs, and loading it into the data warehouse.

- Extraction: Data is gathered from various sources, such as transactional databases, logs, and external sources.
- Transformation: Extracted data is cleaned, aggregated, and formatted to ensure consistency and compatibility with the data warehouse schema.
    - Data cleaning involves removing duplicates, correcting errors, and handling missing values.
    - Data aggregation consolidates data from multiple sources and tables to provide summarized information.
    - Data formatting ensures that data types and structures match the requirements of the data warehouse.
- Loading: Transformed data is loaded into the data warehouse, where it is stored and made available for analysis.

### Query Optimization

Query optimization in data warehousing ensures that data retrieval is efficient and fast.

- Indexes: Indexes are created on columns frequently used in queries to speed up data retrieval.
- Partitioning: Large tables are divided into smaller, manageable pieces based on specific criteria, such as date ranges.
    - Horizontal partitioning splits a table into rows, while vertical partitioning splits a table into columns.
- Caching: Frequently accessed data is stored in memory to reduce retrieval time.
- Parallel Processing: Queries are executed simultaneously across multiple processors or machines to improve performance.

### Data Governance and Security

Maintaining the integrity and security of data in a warehouse is crucial.

- Data Quality Management: Ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and consistent.
    - Regular audits and validation checks are performed.
    - Data quality tools and processes are implemented.
- Access Control: Defining who can access and manipulate data in the warehouse.
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) is commonly used.
    - Encryption is applied to sensitive data to protect it from unauthorized access.
- Compliance: Adhering to legal and regulatory requirements regarding data storage and processing.
    - Compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and others.
    - Implementing policies and procedures to ensure data privacy and security.

### Use Cases of Data Warehousing

Data warehousing is employed in various industries to support decision-making and improve business operations.

- Analyzing sales data to identify trends, optimize inventory, and improve customer satisfaction.
- Monitoring financial transactions, detecting fraud, and ensuring regulatory compliance.
- Managing patient records, improving treatment outcomes, and conducting medical research.
- Analyzing call records, optimizing network performance, and enhancing customer service.

### Future Trends in Data Warehousing

The field of data warehousing is continually evolving with new technologies and practices.

- Moving data warehouses to the cloud for scalability, flexibility, and cost savings.
- Enabling real-time data processing and analysis to support immediate decision-making.
- Incorporating big data technologies to handle large volumes of structured and unstructured data.
- Leveraging AI and ML to automate data analysis, uncover insights, and predict trends.
