## Analyzing Data with Data Warehouses

Data Warehouses serve as specialized repositories for analytical processing, where historical data is aggregated, organized, and optimized for querying large datasets. Transaction systems focus on day-to-day operations (OLTP), while data warehouses enable in-depth analytics (OLAP) to support decision-making and strategic insights.

```

Data flows from operational databases to the data warehouse, then on to analytics tools. This flow decouples critical business operations from computationally intensive reporting queries.

### Star and Snowflake Schemas

```
Star Schema Diagram

      +--------------------+
      |   Dimension (D1)   |
      +---------+----------+
                |
                | (FK)
+---------------+-----------------+
|             FACT TABLE         |
+---------------+-----------------+
                |
                | (FK)
      +---------+----------+
      |   Dimension (D2)   |
      +--------------------+
```

- A single fact table can be **helpful** in capturing core measurements like sales or events.  
- Each fact table often includes **foreign** keys referencing multiple dimension tables (e.g., product, customer).  
- A snowflake schema can be **useful** when dimension tables are further normalized, creating sub-dimensions.  

### Column-Oriented Storage

```
Row-Oriented vs. Column-Oriented (Visual)

Row-Oriented:                  Column-Oriented:
[ R1C1, R1C2, R1C3, ... ]      [ R1C1, R2C1, R3C1, ... ]
[ R2C1, R2C2, R2C3, ... ]      [ R1C2, R2C2, R3C2, ... ]
[ R3C1, R3C2, R3C3, ... ]      [ R1C3, R2C3, R3C3, ... ]
```

- A column store can be **helpful** for analytical workloads where queries often read specific columns across many rows.  
- Large segments of repeated values can be **compressed** efficiently, reducing disk I/O and improving performance.  
- Bitmap encoding can be **practical** for columns with relatively few unique values, and run-length encoding further optimizes repeated bit patterns.  

### Sorting and Materialized Views

```
Sorted vs. Unsorted Columns

Sorted Data  -> [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
Unsorted Data -> [4, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4]
```

- Sorting columns in a consistent order can be **useful** for boosting compression and speeding up range queries.  
- Multiple replicas can be **helpful** if each is sorted differently, targeting distinct query patterns.  
- A materialized view can be **advantageous** when certain queries are repeated often and you want precomputed results.  
- A data cube can be **helpful** for aggregating facts across multiple dimensions, such as calculating sales totals by product and date.  

### Writing Challenges and LSM-Trees

```
       +---------+
       |  Ingest |
       | (Writes)|
       +----+----+
            |
            v
+-----------+-------------+
|     LSM-Tree Process    |
+-----------+-------------+
            |
   Sorted Segments Merge
            |
            v
  +---------------------+
  |  Final Column Store |
  +---------------------+
```

- Updates in columnar storage can be **difficult** because inserting data in sorted structures is expensive.  
- Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees can be **useful** by buffering writes and gradually merging sorted data segments.  
- This approach can be **effective** in high-write analytical systems that need frequent batch loads.  

### Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL)

```
   +-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+
   |  Extract  | -> |Transform  | -> |   Load    |
   +-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+
```

- The extraction phase can be **helpful** in gathering data from multiple operational databases, logs, or external APIs.  
- Transform steps can be **useful** for cleaning, aggregating, and normalizing data to match the warehouse schema.  
- The loading phase is **beneficial** for writing processed data into the data warehouse, ready for analytics.  
- A variation called ELT can be **suitable** if transformation steps occur inside a powerful data warehouse after loading.  

### Query Optimization

```
   +---------------------+
   |   Query Processor   |
   +----------+----------+
             |
             v
   +---------------------+
   | Execution Strategy |
   +----------+---------+
             |
             v
   +---------------------+
   |   Optimized Query   |
   +---------------------+
```

- Indexing columns frequently used in filters can be **practical** for accelerating queries.  
- Partitioning large tables by date or region can be **useful** for reducing data scans.  
- Caching intermediate results can be **helpful** for repeat queries, improving response times.  
- Parallel processing strategies can be **valuable** when distributing workload across multiple machines or nodes.  

### Data Governance and Security

```
+-------------------------+
|  Data Quality Checks    |
+------------+------------+
             |
             v
+-------------------------+
|  Access Control & RBAC  |
+------------+------------+
             |
             v
+-------------------------+
| Encryption & Compliance |
+-------------------------+
```

- Regular audits can be **useful** for detecting data inaccuracies, duplicates, or out-of-date records.  
- Role-based access control (RBAC) can be **helpful** for restricting sensitive data to authorized personnel.  
- Encryption is often **practical** for protecting data at rest and in transit.  
- Compliance with regional and industry regulations can be **important** for organizations handling private data.  

## Use Cases of Data Warehousing

- Sales analytics can be **valuable** for identifying top-selling products, seasonal trends, or customer buying patterns.  
- Financial transaction analysis can be **useful** for detecting fraud and ensuring regulatory alignment.  
- Healthcare analytics can be **helpful** for predicting patient trends and refining treatment protocols.  
- Telecommunications monitoring can be **beneficial** for managing network capacity and improving service quality.  

### Additional Topics

- Metadata management can be **practical** for documenting schema details, data lineage, and update frequency.  
- Data virtualization can be **helpful** if you prefer to query multiple data sources without physically moving data.  
- Data lakes can be **useful** for storing vast amounts of raw, unstructured data, sometimes combined with data warehouses in a lakehouse architecture.  
- Self-service analytics platforms can be **valuable** for enabling end users to explore data without heavy IT involvement.
