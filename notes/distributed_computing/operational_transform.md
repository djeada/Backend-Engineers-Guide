Operational Transform (OT) is a technique used in distributed systems to enable real-time collaborative editing of shared documents.

## The Challenge of Collaborative Editing

Collaborative editing of shared documents is a challenging problem in distributed systems, as multiple users can simultaneously modify the same document. Without some form of coordination or synchronization, the resulting document can become inconsistent or even corrupted.

## How Operational Transform Works

Operational Transform works by transforming a sequence of edits performed by one user into a new sequence of edits that can be applied by another user without causing conflicts. This is done by analyzing the semantic meaning of the edits and identifying any potential conflicts or inconsistencies.

## Types of Operations

Operational Transform can be used to transform different types of operations, including:

* Insertion: Adding new content to the document.
* Deletion: Removing existing content from the document.
* Move: Changing the position of existing content within the document.
* Format: Changing the style or formatting of existing content.

## Implementing Operational Transform

Implementing Operational Transform can be challenging, as it requires careful consideration of the data model used to represent the document, as well as the algorithms used to transform operations. Some popular Operational Transform implementations include:

- Google Docs: A popular web-based collaborative editing platform that uses Operational Transform to synchronize changes across multiple users.

- ShareJS: An open-source Operational Transform library that can be integrated into custom applications.
