## Real-time Communication Methods

Real-time communication methods provide updates from application servers to clients quickly. Consider the benefits and drawbacks of each method for specific use cases.

### Long Polling

- HTTP connection stays open until the server responds
- Client makes another long polling request after receiving a response
- Easier to implement, but can overload servers with many clients

### WebSockets

- Full-duplex communication between client and server
- Reduces message overhead as headers don't need to be resent
- Harder to implement than long polling, but supports many open connections

### Server-Sent Events

- One-way communication from server to client
- Keeps an open connection for sending multiple requests
- Best for situations where the server generates data in a loop and sends updates to clients
