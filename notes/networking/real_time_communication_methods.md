## Real-time Communication Methods

Real-time communication methods are techniques used to provide updates to a client from an application server in a timely manner. When deciding which method to use, it's important to consider the benefits and drawbacks of each in relation to the specific use case.

### Long Polling

Long polling is a technique where an HTTP connection is opened with the server and kept open until the server has something to respond with. Once the server responds, the client then makes another long polling request. This method is relatively easy to implement but can overload a server if many clients are doing so simultaneously.

### WebSockets

WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels between the client and server, which reduces message overhead as headers do not need to be resent. While harder to implement than long polling, WebSockets can support up to 65,000 open connections as ports.

### Server-Sent Events

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a one-way communication method, where events are sent from the server to the client, while keeping an open connection. This method is best suited for situations where the server is generating data in a loop and needs to send multiple requests to clients.
