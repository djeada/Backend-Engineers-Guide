## Proxies

Proxies act as intermediaries between clients and application servers, performing tasks like modifying requests, caching, or encrypting/decrypting messages.

### Types of Proxies

- Open Proxies: Accessible by any internet user
- Anonymous Proxies: Reveal their identity as a server but not the user's IP address
- Transparent Proxies: Identify themselves and the user's IP address, good for caching websites
- Reverse Proxies: Retrieve resources from one or more application servers and return the result to the client as if they were their own. Can perform tasks like encryption/decryption to save application servers from performing these potentially expensive operations.

### Additional Benefits

- Security and privacy: Proxies can mask user's IP addresses and protect data sent over the network.
- Bypass geographic restrictions: Proxies can be used to access content that is restricted to certain locations.
- Block malicious websites: Proxies can prevent access to harmful websites.
