## Proxies

Proxies act as an intermediary between the client and application server, enabling a variety of tasks such as adding information to a request, checking its own cache, or encrypting/decrypting a message.

#### Types of Proxies
- Open Proxies: Accessible by any internet user
- Anonymous Proxies: Reveal its identity as a server but does not disclose the IP address of the user
- Transparent Proxies: Identify both themselves and the IP address of the user, good for caching websites
- Reverse Proxies: Retrieves resources from one or more application servers and then returns the result to the client as if they were their own. Can perform tasks such as encryption/decryption to save application servers from performing these potentially expensive operations.

Proxies also provide additional security and privacy for users, as they can mask the user's IP address and protect any data sent over the network. Additionally, proxies can be used to bypass geographic restrictions and block malicious websites.
