Understanding Load and Performance Metrics

When designing and evaluating a system, it is crucial to understand the performance characteristics and potential bottlenecks. There are various metrics that can be used to measure performance, and it is important to choose the appropriate metrics based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the system.

### Throughput

* The number of records or requests processed per second.
* Good for batch jobs or systems with high volume of requests.
* Measured in requests per second (RPS) or records per second (RPS).

### Response Time

* The time taken between a client sending a request and receiving a response.
* More relevant when discussing online systems where low latency is important.
* Measured in milliseconds (ms) or seconds (s).

### Latency

* The duration that a request spends waiting to be handled.
* Can be affected by various factors, such as network latency, server processing time, and database query time.
* Measured in milliseconds (ms) or seconds (s).

### Tail Latency

* Describes the latency at a certain percentile of requests.
* For example, a tail latency metric of 1 second for p95 indicates that 95% of requests have a lower latency than 1 second, while the remaining 5% have a higher latency.
* Tail latency is important to consider as it can indicate the presence of outliers or bottlenecks that can affect the overall user experience.

### Other Metrics

* Error rate: the number of requests that resulted in an error, measured as a percentage or ratio.
* CPU utilization: the percentage of CPU usage by the system.
* Memory usage: the amount of memory used by the system.
* Disk I/O: the rate of data read and written to disk.
* Network traffic: the rate of data transferred over the network.
* These additional metrics can help to identify the specific performance bottlenecks and areas of improvement in the system.
