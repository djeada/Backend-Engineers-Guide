# Web Server Overview

Backend engineers often need to manage and maintain servers that host web applications, APIs, and databases. Understanding server management is crucial for ensuring performance, reliability, and security.

## Client-server Architecture
Client-server architecture is a computing model in which the server hosts, delivers, and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client. This model is widely used in networked systems and the internet.

1. **Client**: 
   - The client is the requester of services or resources.
   - It can be a user's device like a computer, phone, or any other device capable of network communication.
   - Clients can vary in capability (thick client, thin client, smart client).

2. **Server**: 
   - A server is a provider of services or resources.
   - It can be a database server, file server, mail server, web server, or any other system that provides resources to clients.
   - Servers are typically more powerful and have higher resources than clients.

3. **Communication**:
   - Communication occurs over a network, where clients send requests to a server and receive responses.
   - Protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and others govern this communication.

  +-----------+            +-----------+
  |  Client 1 |            |  Client 2 |
  +-----+-----+            +-----+-----+
        ^                        ^
        |                        |
        |  Request/Response      |  Request/Response
        |                        |
        v                       ^
  +-----+-----+            +-----+-----+
  |           |            |           |
  |           +------------>           |
  |  Server   <------------+  Server   |
  |           |            |           |
  |           |            |           |
  +-----+-----+            +-----+-----+
        ^                        ^
        |                        |
        v                        ^
  +-----+-----+            +-----+-----+
  |  Client 3 |            |  Client 4 |
  +-----------+            +-----------+
```

### Architecture Patterns

1. **Two-Tier Architecture**:
   - Direct communication between client and server.
   - Common in small applications or where real-time operations are not critical.

2. **Three-Tier Architecture**:
   - Includes a middle layer (application layer) between the client and server.
   - Useful for more complex applications, adding a layer of abstraction and security.

3. **N-Tier/Multi-Tier Architecture**:
   - More complex, with additional layers such as business logic layer, data access layer, etc.
   - Offers better scalability and maintainability.

### Advantages

- **Scalability**: Servers can handle multiple clients simultaneously.
- **Maintenance**: Easier to update and maintain the backend without affecting the clients.
- **Security**: Centralized control over data and resources enhances security measures.
- **Resource Sharing**: Efficient utilization of resources and data sharing.

### Disadvantages

- **Dependency**: Clients heavily depend on servers for resources and services.
- **Network Dependency**: Requires a continuous network connection.
- **Congestion**: High client requests can lead to server overload.

## Server Types

1. **Dedicated Servers**: Physical servers dedicated to one application or customer. They offer high performance and control but are more expensive.

2. **Virtual Private Servers (VPS)**: A portion of a physical server's resources is allocated to act as a separate server. VPS offers a balance between performance, control, and cost.

3. **Cloud Servers**: Provided by cloud service providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). They offer scalability and flexibility but may have variable costs.

      +-----------+
      |  Client 1 |
      +-----+-----+
            |
            | HTTP Request
            v
+-----------------------+
|      Web Server       |
|-----------------------|
| - Hosts Web Pages     |
| - Processes Requests  |
| - Sends Responses     |
+-----------------------+
            ^
            | HTTP Response
            |
      +-----+-----+
      |  Client 2 |
      +-----------+
```

## Operating Systems

- **Linux**: Popular for its stability, security, and open-source nature. Common distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian.
- **Windows Server**: Used in environments that require specific Windows applications.

## Server Configuration

- **Web Server Software**: Apache, Nginx, IIS.
- **Database Servers**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
- **Caching Systems**: Redis, Memcached.
- **Environment Setup**: Installing necessary libraries, setting up programming environments (e.g., Node.js, Python).

## Security

- **Firewalls**: Configuring firewalls to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
- **SSL/TLS Certificates**: Implementing HTTPS for secure communication.
- **User Access Control**: Setting up secure SSH access, using key-based authentication.
- **Regular Updates**: Keeping the OS and software up-to-date with security patches.

## Performance Tuning

- **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic across multiple servers.
- **Caching Strategies**: Implementing caching to reduce database load.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Tools like `top`, `htop`, `nmon` for monitoring server resources.

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

- **Regular Backups**: Automating database and file backups.
- **Redundancy**: Setting up redundant systems or databases to prevent single points of failure.
- **Recovery Plan**: Having a clear plan for restoring data and services in case of failure.

## Automation and CI/CD

- **Scripting**: Automating routine tasks with scripts (e.g., Bash, Python).
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment**: Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI for automating testing and deployment.
