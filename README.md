# Backend Engineer's Guide

This repository is a collection I've put together, focusing on various backend engineering topics. It's a place where you can find information on API design, databases, deployment, distributed computing, networking, performance optimization, security, and even more specialized areas. Each topic is broken down into a Markdown file, found in the notes directory. Here, I've tried my best to provide detailed notes, explanations, and examples.

I try to keep these notes updated and expanded regularly, aiming to provide up-to-date, relevant information. Of course, if you have any contributions or suggestions, they're more than welcome. We're all learning together, after all.

## Getting Started

To begin, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the "notes" directory to access each topic's Markdown file.

    git clone https://github.com/your_username/Backend-Engineers-Guide.git
    cd Backend-Engineers-Guide/notes
